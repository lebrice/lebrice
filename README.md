I'm a ML Research Enginner* at Mila, the Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute [(Mila)](https://mila.quebec/en/). I have a Masters in Machine Learning from Université de Montréal / Mila.
Before that, I did a Bachelors in Computer Engineering at McGill, during which I completed four Software Engineering internships.
I was until recently an AI researcher at Mila doing my Master's thesis in Continual Learning with [Irina Rish](https://sites.google.com/view/irinarish/). You can see [my list of publications here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SZIdARAAAAAJ).

My job is to **help make AI researchers more productive**. I do this in several ways:

- I create useful software tools and libraries to help researchers use GPU clusters productively in their day-to-day. For example: [simpleparsing](www.github.com/lebrice/simpleparsing), [Sequoia](www.github.com/lebrice/Sequoia), [milatools](www.github.com/mila-iqia/milatools), [a Research Project Template](www.github.com/mila-iqia/ResearchTemplate), [torch-jax-interop](www.github.com/lebrice/torch_jax_interop), [tensor_regression](www.github.com/lebrice/tensor_regression), and many more.
- I prepare and present interactive tutorials to teach good research and software engineering practices to researchers. For example, I give tutorials on writing GPU-friendly training scripts, [debugging distributed training jobs](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1q4JkrkztXYK0nc7fkFGWGQcu4dY17HaCoj8Zk2QTcYc/edit?usp=sharing), how to do [profiling of GPU jobs and how to interpret profiler traces](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1q4JkrkztXYK0nc7fkFGWGQcu4dY17HaCoj8Zk2QTcYc/edit?usp=sharing), how to write clean code, how to do proper testing, etc.
- I created and hold the IDT Office Hours at Mila, where researchers walk in with their laptop, and I help them sort out their issues and optimize their code. This has led me to meet a significant portion of the 1000+ researchers here at Mila, and to get to help on a very wide range of ML workflows.

As for my own research, my interests revolve around Continual Learning, Self-Supervised Learning, and **Reinforcement Learning**.
Here are some interesting things I've done:
- Launched LLM pre-training jobs using up to **100 nodes** and **400 A100 GPUs** while monitoring the scaling behaviour, performance bottlenecks and resource utilization. ([Wandb report link here](https://api.wandb.ai/links/lebrice/77ms1m17))
- Scaled up RL training (PQN algo) on up to ~200 000 parallel environments, using **16 nodes** and **64 H100 gpus**. ([Project link](https://www.github.com/lebrice/scaling_pqn))

Appart from this, I also have a great passion for **videogames, sound design for games, as well as videogame lore**. My gamedev experience so far consists of one serious gamedev class at McGill, as well as writing a few little Unity projects on the side. I'd like to get more seriously involved in game development/design someday (hopefully soon).

On a more personal note, here are some other things I enjoy:
- Making GPUs go Brrrr
- Sharing something neat and wonderful with others (cute bits of code, new songs, food, movies, etc.)
- Fixing/repairing broken things in an elegant way
- Philosophical discussions
- Getting destroyed in code reviews (no, really, I love it!)
- Chess / Videogames / Videogame development (playing around in Unity)
- Classical / Electronic music

\*: My official job title is "Software Developer in Machine Learning" because of the office of engineers of Quebec.
