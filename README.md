I'm a Machine Learning software developer at Mila, the Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute [(Mila)](https://mila.quebec/en/). I just finished my Masters degree in Machine Learning at the UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al.
Prior to this, I studied Computer Engineering, and had the privilege of completing four Software Engineering internships, one of which was in applied Machine Learning research.

My research interests generally revolve around Generative models (GANs in particular), Self-Supervised Learning, **Continual Learning**, and, more recently, Reinforcement Learning.

There is still a lot of work to be done before we are able to create systems that can both adapt to changes in their environment, as well as retain previously acquired knowledge. My current goal is to promote and further research in this field.

Appart from this, I also have a great passion for **videogames, sound design for games, as well as videogame lore**. My gamedev experience so far consists of one serious gamedev class at McGill, as well as writing a few little Unity projects on the side. I'd like to get more seriously involved in game development/design someday (hopefully soon).

On a more personal note, here are some other things I enjoy:
- Sharing something neat and wonderful with others (cute bits of code, new songs, food, movies, etc.)
- Fixing/repairing broken things in an elegant way
- Philosophical discussions
- Getting destroyed in code reviews (no, really, I love it!)
- Chess / Videogames / Videogame development (playing around in Unity)
- Classical / Electronic music
