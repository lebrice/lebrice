I am completing the second year of a Research Masters degree at the Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute (Mila).
Prior to this, I studied Computer Engineering, and had the privilege of completing four Software Engineering internships, one of which was in applied Machine Learning research.

Some of my research interests include Generative models (GANs in particular), Self-Supervised Learning, and Continual Learning.

There is still a lot of work to be done before we are able to create systems that can both adapt to changes in their environment, as well as retain previously acquired knowledge. My current goal is to promote and further research in this field.
Here are some ideas to get you started:
